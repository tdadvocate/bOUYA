    <p>The Devkits are the pre-production units that were the first of the OUYA to ever have been made. These units were intended only to be used by Developers so that they could get their software ready for the console well ahead of it's official public production and even the Kickstarter production runs. This console was made of extremely cheap and early materials so they tended to break very easily. Unfortunately that means that not many of them exist anymore and are rather rare to come by. It was made of a translucent colourless plastic.</p>

    <p>These units were a limited run of kickstarter backer units. These are near identical to the future production run of units. The main difference is that thes came in pre-production boxes and used a metalic bronze finish to the consoles and their accompanying controller.</p>

    <p>Another limited run of kickstarter backer units. These units had the usernames of the top backers engraved onto the side of a near identical unit to what was sent out to the pre-order and production units outside of the engravings. These units used the same metalic silver finishing on the consoles and accompanying controllers. They were also packaged in pre-production boxes similar to the bronze units.</p>

  <div class="textBox">
    <p>The Silver Production units are the final product that were shipped out to the pre-order backers as well as on store shelves around the world. These units are the most common of units in circulation and have the typical metalic finish that most people imagine when they think of the OUYA consoles and controllers.</p>

    <p>Anthracite consoles were a later in life model of the OUYA. These units were near identical to the production units other than the fact that they used a black finish to the console and accompanying controllers. They even used the same boxes as the typical production units.</p>

  <div class="textBox">
    <p>The white consoles were the last iteration of the OUYA before they stopped production of the console. These units had a very short production lifecycle and are unfortunately relatively rare. These units are more sought after due to them having slighlty upgraded hardware from their predecessors. The console and accompanying controllers used a glossy white finish unlike the production or anthracite units.</p>
