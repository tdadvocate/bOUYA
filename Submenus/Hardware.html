    <p>Obviously this is an extrememly early concept of the page. The Devkits are the pre-production units that were the first of the OUYA to ever have been made. These units were intended only to be used by Developers so that they could get their software ready for the console well ahead of it's official public production and even the Kickstarter production runs. This console was made of extremely cheap and early materials so they tended to break very easily. Unfortunately that means that not many of them exist anymore and are incredibly rare to come by. It was made of a translucent colourless plastic.</p>
