<p class="ouyaLabel">Welcome to bOUYA (boo-yah). This site will serve as an unofficial one stop shop for everything you need to know about the now defunct OUYA. Right now this is extremely barebones because it was done in like 15 minutes. The goal is to at least be a knowledge base of the history and hardware for the OUYA. If I can I will try to add legal links to software that is no longer available anywhere else. That being said, enjoy the site!</p>
<br>
<p class="ouyaLabel">Home will have maybe some cool stuff that is just highlighted for being nifty. Not entirely sure yet. Possibly add a link to the Ouya Saviour discord.</p>
<br>
<p class="ouyaLabel">History will be about the kickstarter in the beginning to Razer's acquisition of the company to its final days leading to its shutdown.</p>
<br>
<p class="ouyaLabel">Hardware will be a knowledge base of all hardware available to purchase officially from the company. Things like consoles and controllers. These will have images, specs, and descriptions at the very least. Possibly history/release dates if applicable.</p>
<br>
<p class="ouyaLabel">Software will hopefully be the GitHub repo files, ODK, tutorials, etc that can legally be acquired and uploaded to the site or mirrored.</p>
<br>
<p class="ouyaLabel">Games will have a list of all games and possibly if i can get help descriptions, images, and videos of the games. If i can legally link games for people to download i will also do that. I will have multiple lists as well as ways to sort the lists. things like release dates, alphabetically, available to download from the site, etc.</p>
