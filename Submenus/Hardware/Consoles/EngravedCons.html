    <p style=text-transform:uppercase>*This topic is still being researched*</p><p>This is the first production run of the OUYA console. These units had 12 Angel List Backer's usernames engraved into one side of the console. These were shipped to approximately 1,012 backers and maybe more. Unfortunately the exact numbers are hard to determine. These units were shipped alongside the Bronze Kickstarter units to early backers and Angel List backers in March of 2013.</p>

    <p>There were 2 ways to get this console but only 1 way to get your name engraved onto these units. For $95 you could back the project to guarantee a first production run of the unit which was limited to 1,000 backers as well as a second controller. These units were engraved with the names of the Angel List Backers. These backers spent $10,000 and only 20 slots were available. Only 12 slots were claimed before the Campaign had ended. These Angel List Backers received the following according to the Kickstarter Campaign page: "The entire first production run of consoles will have YOUR USERNAME and BACKER NUMBER ENGRAVED INTO IT (and of course you'll get one). We’ll invite you and a friend to a private dinner before our launch party with our inner circle of game developers and designers. And, of course, we’ll love you forever."</p>
