    <p style=text-transform:uppercase>*This topic is still being researched*</p><p>During the kickstarter campaign there was an option to back the project to receive an early developer console. This was intended to allow developers to create games for the platform ahead of the official retail launch of the system. The exact pledge amount is still being researched as many details about this system have been lost/buried over the years. It appears that approximately 1200 of these units were shipped out in December of 2012. According to the Kickstarter page there were 600 of these units provided to backers at the cost of $699 USD and 226 units for $1,337 USD. Unfortunately these systems were prone to hardware failure and were typically replaced with production versions of the system so they are becoming more scarce as time progresses.</p>

    <p>Backers who pledged the $1,337 option were considered "Elite Developers". They were provided "the email equivalent of a hotline into OUYA—a closely guarded email address that gives you direct access to our team and priority handling" alongside the rewards of the normal developer backers. The $699 backers were provided "first-run OUYA (already rooted so you can just get going), EARLY SDK ACCESS, an extra controller, [official help getting started, official help promoting their games for ONE YEAR, and their games were] marked with a FOUNDER EMBLEM."</p>
