    <p style=text-transform:uppercase>*This topic is still being researched*</p><p>The Reading Rainbow units were a special Kickstarter reward for people that backed the Reading Rainbow Kickstarter that ran from June to July 2nd, 2014. These units were intended to be "Rainbow-in-the-Sky" Blue and signed by LeVar Burton (best known for his work on Star Trek). These units were intended to ship with identical hardware to all previous limited edition consoles including the 16GB eMMC flash storage. Unfortunately OUYA was unable to fulfill the units as the Blue shell. Kickstarter backers were informed later that they would be receiving the Anthracite units with Mr. Burton's signature to still provide the backers with a product for their money.</p>

    <p>These units were sold at 2 different costs via the "Bring Reading Rainbow Back for Every Child, Everywhere!"" Kickstarter Campaign. The first was a $175 additional pledge for any current backer of the campaign or $250 outright for new Backers. All Backers were provided a $10 OUYA game gift card to make up for the unplanned console issues. The Backers were alerted of this change sometime in February of 2015 after having missed the initial December 2014 ship date the Kickstarter had promised. There appears to have been somewhere over 100 units signed based on the image below of Mr. Burton signing the units.</p>
